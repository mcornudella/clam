<h2>What is CLAM?</h2>

<p><strong>CLAM</strong> allows you to quickly and transparently transform your
command line application into a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a>
webservice and web interface, with which both human end-users as well as
automated clients can interact.</p>

<p><strong>CLAM</strong> expects a description of your system and
wraps itself around the system, allowing end-users or automated clients to
upload input files to your application, start your application with specific
parameters of their choice, and download and view the output of the application
once it is completed.</p>

<p><strong>CLAM</strong> is set up in a universal fashion, requiring minimal
effort on the part of the service developer. Your actual application is
treated as a black box, of which only the parameters, input formats and output
formats need to be described. Your application itself needs not be network
aware in any way, nor aware of CLAM, and the handling and validation of input
can be taken care of by CLAM.</p>

<p><strong>CLAM</strong> is entirely written in Python and runs on UNIX-derived
systems. A Python API is provided, but knowledge of Python is not necessary to
use CLAM. CLAM communicates using a transparent XML format, and uses XSL
transformation offers a full web 2.0 web-interface for human end users.</p>

<p><strong>CLAM</strong> is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the <a

<p><strong>CLAM</strong> is written by Maarten van Gompel, Centre of Language
Studies, Radboud University Nijmegen. </p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>
Check back often as updates are released regularly for <strong>CLAM</strong>. These can be easily installed through the Python Package Index or directly from Github. Bug reports, feature requests and requests for assistance can be submitted through <a href="https://github.com/proycon/clam/issues?state=open">github</a>, the mailing list, or by mailing to <a href="mailto:proycon@anaproy.nl">proycon@anaproy.nl</a>.
</p>

<p>A public roadmap of planned features for the future, as well as bug reports about existing features, can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/proycon/clam/issues?state=open">CLAM Issue Tracker</a>. Feel free to add any problems or feature requests if you have a (free) github account!</p>

<h2>Download and installation</h2>

<p>CLAM is maintained at the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CLAM/">Python Package Index</a>. It is available for Linux and other UNIX-like distributions and is intended for users who want to build a webservice around their own tool, want to write a client for existing CLAM webservices, or are system administrators setting up existing CLAM services. </p>

<p>To automatically download and install CLAM from the <strong>Python Package Index</strong>, the convenient tool <tt>pip</tt> is available, it may be called <tt>pip3</tt> if you want to use Python 3 (recommended):</p>

<code data-lang="bash">
$ pip3 install clam
</code>


<p>We recommend the use of a Python Virtual Environment</p>

<p>The source code is also available through the source code repository at <a href="https://github.com/proycon/clam">github</a></p>

<p>
Please consult the <a href="https://clam.readthedocs.io/en/stable">CLAM Documentation</a> for further instructions, including installation details. After reading the documentation, it is recommended to watch the CLAM tutorial videos at the bottom of this page.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<img class="big" src="architecture.png" alt="CLAM architecture" />

<p>CLAM has a layered architecture, with at the core the NLP application(s) you want to turn into a webservice. The application itself can remain untouched and unaware of CLAM. The scheme on the right illustrates the various layers.</p>

<p>Read more in the CLAM Manual and also see the <a href="clam_poster.png">CLAM poster</a> presented at CLIN 21.</p>

<strong>Tutorial</strong> (September 2015) - This tutorial shows everything you need to get started, it shows how to make a webservice for a simple command-line tool<br />

<p>The below instruction videos are older (2011), but still useful:</p>

<strong>Part III</strong> - We will take a deeper look into the metadata and parameter abilities of CLAM.</br />
<br />
<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="320" height="260" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/guvtndqjVds" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<strong>Part IV</strong> - In this video we will see how to write a client in Python to connect to the webservice we created earlier. We will use the CLAM Client API<br />
